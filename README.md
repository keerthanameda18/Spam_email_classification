# Spam_email_classification
This Flask-based web application is a robust spam detector. It trains and compares multiple machine learning models—Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and XGBoost—on a combined email dataset. The app provides a dashboard with performance visualizations and uses an ensemble approach for classifying new messages as spam or not spam.
